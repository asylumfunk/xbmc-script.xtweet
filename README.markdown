WARNING: DEPRECATED
===================

DO NOT INSTALL
--------------
This was originally written to scratch an itch 5 years ago.

Since then, the Twitter and XBMC APIs have matured and as a result,
this script no longer functions.

I may bring it back up-to-date at some point, but in the interim,
it sits here merely for posterity.

****************************************

xTweet, v1.6
=================================================

Installation
------------
- Copy the "xTweet\" directory to the "scripts\" directory
inside of your XBMC installation.
- Voila!

Use
---
- When you first run the script, it will ask for your
Twitter username and password.
	- Note: You can always update this later with the
	"Edit account settings" option on the main menu.
- From the main menu, you can...
	- tweet about the song/video that you have playing
	- update your status
	- view your Friends Timeline
	- view Followers and Following lists
	- @reply to Tweets
	- send Direct Messages
	- view the Direct Messages you have sent and received
	- reply to and delete Direct Messages
	- view @mentions
	- search
	- authenticate via OAuth
	- edit your account settings
