=================================================

Interact with Twitter directly from XBMC!

Installation:
	- Copy the "xTweet\" directory to the "scripts\" directory
	inside of your XBMC installation.
	- Voila!

Use:
	- When you first run the script, it will ask for your Twitter username and password.
		- Note: You can always update this later with the "Edit account settings" option on the main menu.
	- From the main menu, you can either tweet automatically about the song/video that you have playing
		or you can enter in a status yourself.

Coming Soon:
	- the ability to search Twitter, view timelines, and direct messages
