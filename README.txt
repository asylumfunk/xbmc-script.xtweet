=================================================

Interact with Twitter directly from XBMC!

Installation:
	- Copy the "xTweet\" directory to the "scripts\" directory
	inside of your XBMC installation.
	- Voila!

Use:
	- When you first run the script, it will ask for your Twitter username and password.
		- Note: You can always update this later with the "Edit account settings" option on the main menu.
	- From the main menu, you can...
		- tweet about the song/video that you have playing
		- update your status
		- view your Friends Timeline
		- view Followers and Following lists
		- @reply to Tweets
		- send Direct Messages
		- view the Direct Messages you have sent and received
		- reply to and delete Direct Messages
		- edit your account settings

Coming Soon:
	- the ability to search Twitter

Support:

Supported Languages (author in parenthesis):
	- English (AsylumFunk)

If your native language isn't supported yet and you'd like to help out with translation, I'd love to hear from you! My goal is to see xTweet available in as many languages as possible.
